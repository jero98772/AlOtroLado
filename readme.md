**To the Other Side**  

The name is from a Colombian philosopher, Fernando González, who named his things like... his thesis work "another thesis", his house "another part", that's why this is called the other side "al otro lado" in spanish

A web page designed to calculate safer routes in the city of Medellín. Using Medellín's open data, it identifies the most dangerous areas.

### Problem and Why It Was Made:

This started as a university assignment but aimed to go further by adding creativity and utility.  

The idealized solution proposed in the assignment was:

> "Since certain places in the city are dangerous, the goal is to eliminate the danger."

However, this isn't realistic.

> "...But it is possible to reduce the danger by generating a route that avoids these dangerous areas, helping users stay away from them."

The "real" solution, however, requires a societal change.  

> Solutions don’t always work perfectly. They work better as optimizations. Sometimes, what we think is a solution is actually just a new problem.  

This project aims to make the issue appear less daunting.

**If it doesn't solve the problem, why was it created?**

Because doing something matters. One action is worth more than a thousand words.  
Anyone can talk about change, but very few actually do something—most just complain.

This project embraced that social discussion. That’s why it was made accessible.  

It’s open-source so that others can use or build on it as they see fit. But the ultimate goal is to raise awareness of the problem and contribute to progress.

It’s also a web-based tool for better distribution and reach—because it’s pointless if only one person has access to it.
